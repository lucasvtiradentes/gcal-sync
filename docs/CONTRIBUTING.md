# Contribution guidelines

First of all, thanks for thinking of contributing to this project. :smile:

Before sending a Pull Request, please make sure that you're assigned the task on a GitHub issue.

- If a relevant issue already exists, discuss on the issue and get it assigned to yourself on GitHub.
- If no relevant issue exists, open a new issue and get it assigned to yourself on GitHub.

Please proceed with a Pull Request only after you're assigned. It'd be sad if your Pull Request (and your hardwork) isn't accepted just because it isn't ideologically compatible.

# Developing

1. Install with:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/lucasvtiradentes/gcal-sync
   cd gcal-sync
   npm install
   ```

2. Make your changes in a different git branch (say, `add-new-flag`). These changes can be:

   - adding better docs;
   - adding more flag options.

3. Test if `gcal-sync` is working properly, by:

   ```sh
   npm run test
   ```

4. Push your code to a new brach and create the pull request.
